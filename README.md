# **HELLOWORLD**

# **Overview**

We created a simple "Hello World" software in Java. The purpose of a "Hello World" program is typically to ensure that the programming environment is set up correctly and that a basic program can be successfully compiled and executed.

The "Helloword" software is a simple "Hello World" program designed to introduce beginners to Java programming. It defines a class named helloworld with a main method, which is the entry point for the program. Within the main method, a single statement is executed using the System.out.println() method to print the message "Hello World, This is Java so let's get started." to the console. This concise program serves as a basic introduction to the syntax of Java, demonstrating how to create a class, define a main method, and output text to the console.

This software is to used as an initial step for individuals learning Java to ensure their development environment is set up correctly and they can successfully compile and run a simple Java program.

# **Development Environment**

* Microsoft Visual Studio
* JDK
* Git/GitHub

The "Helloworld" software is written in Java, which is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). Java is known for its platform independence, as programs written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used for developing various types of applications, including web applications, mobile applications (Android), enterprise systems, and more.
